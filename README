The Health Tracker API is a FastAPI-based application that allows users to monitor and manage their health data, including physical activities, sleep patterns, and blood test results. The application provides a /get_health_score endpoint that calculates an aggregated health score for a user, incorporating physical activity, sleep, and blood test metrics. The health score is returned in a FHIR-compliant format, making it compatible with healthcare standards.

Includes:

    CRUD operations for Users

    CRUD operations for PhysicalActivity, SleepActivity, and BloodTest

    /get_health_score endpoint: calculates a userâ€™s overall health score

    FHIR-compliant JSON output for the health score

    Install Python dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Running the Project (Docker)

        Build and start the containers:

            docker-compose up --build


    The FastAPI application will be available at:

        http://localhost:8000

    Database Migrations

        The project uses Alembic for database migrations. To apply migrations:

        Generate a migration (if you add new models):

            alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add description of migration"


        Apply migrations:

            alembic upgrade head
